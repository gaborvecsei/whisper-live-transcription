# Live Transcription with Whisper PoC client-server

Live transcription PoC with the Whisper model (using `faster-whisper`) in a client-server setup where the server can handle multiple clients.

# Sample

Sample with a `Macbook Pro (M1)`

https://github.com/gaborvecsei/whisper-live-transcription/assets/18753533/3a4667ce-9af2-4dfe-aa68-8c9ad6307e74

(_ðŸ”ˆ sound on_, `faster-whisper` package, `base` model - latency was around 0.5s)

# Setup

- `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `$ mkdir models`

# Run

* Before running the `server.py` modify the parameters inside the file

## Gradio interface

```shell
# Start the server (RestAPI)
python server.py

# --------------------------------

# Start the Gradio interface on localhost (HTTP)
python ui_client.py

# Start the Gradio interface with their sharing - this way the it'll be HTTPS without the need of certs
SHARE=1 python ui_client.py

# Start the Gradio interface with your own certs
SSL_CERT_PATH=<PATH> SSL_KEY_PATH=<PATH> python ui_client.py
```

## In the command line

```shell
python server.py
python cli_client.py
```

There are a few parameters in each script that you can modify

# How does it work?

This beautiful art will explain this:

```
- step = 1
- length = 4

$t$ is the current time (1 second of audio to be precise)

------------------------------------------
1st second: [t,   0,   0,   0] --> "Hi"
2nd second: [t-1, t,   0,   0] --> "Hi I am"
3rd second: [t-2, t-1, t,   0] --> "Hi I am the one"
4th second: [t-3, t-2, t-1, t] --> "Hi I am the one and only Gabor"
5th second: [t,   0,   0,   0] --> "How" --> Here we started the process again, and the output is in a new line
6th second: [t-1, t,   0,   0] --> "How are"
etc...
------------------------------------------

```

# Improvements

- Use a [`VAD`](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) on the client side, and either send the audio for transcription when we detect a longer silence (e.g. 1 sec) or if there is no silence we can fall back to the maximum length.
- Transcribe shorter timeframes to get more instant transcriptions and meanwhile, we can use larger timeframes to "correct" already transcribed parts (async correction)
