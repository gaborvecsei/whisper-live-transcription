# Setup

- `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `$ mkdir models`

## `whisper.cpp` based (`ggml`) ([`whisper-cpp-python`](https://github.com/carloscdias/whisper-cpp-python) and [`whispercpp`](https://github.com/aarnphm/whispercpp) packages)

- Download `ggml` whisper model binaries: [how-to](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/models) and place them in the models folder
  - [available ggml models](https://ggml.ggerganov.com/)
- Adjust parameters in the script

## `faster-whisper` package

- Nothing to do

# Run

```
$ python ./live-transcribe.py
```

# How it works?

I this beautiful art will explain it:

```
- step = 1
- length = 4

$t$ is the current tie (1 second of audio to be precise)

------------------------------------------
1st second: [t,   0,   0,   0] --> "Hi"
2nd second: [t-1, t,   0,   0] --> "Hi I am"
3rd second: [t-2, t-1, t,   0] --> "Hi I am the one"
4th second: [t-3, t-2, t-1, t] --> "Hi I am the one and only Gabor"
5th second: [t,   0,   0,   0] --> "How" --> Here we started the process again, and the output is in a new line
6th second: [t-1, t,   0,   0] --> "How are"
etc...
------------------------------------------

```
